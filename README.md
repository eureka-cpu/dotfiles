# eureka's dotfiles

Welcome, these are the dotfiles for my varies nix/nixos systems. The idea is that modules and configuration
options can be shared between systems as needed and between declared users. The outcome may look different
depending on which desktop environment is chosen.

Currently the following desktop environments are configured for my systems:

- Gnome ([dev-one] HP Dev One Notebook)
- Hyprland ([tensorbook] Razer Blade 15 X Lambda Tensorbook 2022 with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ti, [critter-tank] MS-7D73 -- AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 discrete and AMD Raphael integrated graphics, [yabai] MacBook Pro M1)
- Sway ([xie] Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x -- Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) -- this one is a bit experimental still

I also have some non-nixos configurations for nix-darwin and other linux partitions that are not part of this repository as of writing this.

What the outcome might look like depending on which wallpaper/colors/topbar is used:
